PROFILE

I am a final year undergraduate student at The University of New Mexico in the business year undergraduate focusing on the school of Multimedia journalism. I have learned many different skills while in the journalism program. some of these skills include interviewing, where I have had experience talking with strangers to get their takes on stories. I have had training in audio and visual equipment and I have used both in the field. I also have become proficient in writing in a journalistic style to complete my many assignments of articles. 

EXPERIANCE

As a journalism student, I have published multiple articles pertaining to multiple topics. I have covered the rise of the marijuana industry when legalized in New Mexico. I also covered the treasury race in last year's political election in New Mexico and even got to attend a political viewing party to interview important people who were competent on the topics. I have also covered a series of smaller events like food truck festivals and the migration of the sandhill cranes through new mexico in the winter.
